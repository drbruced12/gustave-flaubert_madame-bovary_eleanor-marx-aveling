        To Marie-Antoine-Jules Senard Member of the Paris Bar, Ex-President of
        the National Assembly, and Former Minister of the Interior Dear and
        Illustrious Friend, Permit me to inscribe your name at the head of this
        book, and above its dedication; for it is to you, before all, that I owe
        its publication. Reading over your magnificent defence, my work has
        acquired for myself, as it were, an unexpected authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accept, then, here, the homage of my gratitude, which, how great soever
        it is, will never attain the height of your eloquence and your devotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gustave Flaubert, Paris, 12 April 1857
